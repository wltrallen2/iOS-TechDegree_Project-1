This project was created to satisfy the requirements of the
**Team TreeHouse iOS TechDegree - Project #1**.

It divides a hard-coded dictionary of team players into three equal
teams, ensuring that each team has an equal number of players with
expeience and an equal number of players without experience and that
each team's average height is within 1.5 inches of the other teams'
average heights.

The program then creates Welcome Letters for each team and outputs
those letters to the console.
